# Class: D308 Mobile Application Development
This is my final project for this class. I have created a small android application built with Java.
This application was written in Android studio and it uses the Room framework to persist a database.
It is a mobile application for booking a vacation. There is a runnable apk file under app/release/app.release.apk
